For an SR latch, what will be the outputs (Q, Q') when the following inputs are applied: S = 0 and R = 1?
Q = 0, Q' = 1
Q = 1, Q' = 0
Q = 1, Q' = 1
Invalid State

What is the main difference in the operation of a D latch compared to an SR latch?
D latch requires a clock signal, whereas an SR latch does not.
D latch eliminates the invalid state of the SR latch (when S and R are both 1)
D latch has three inputs while SR latch has two.
D latch can store two bits of data, whereas SR latch can store only one.

How does a D flip-flop differ from a D latch in terms of data storage and output?
D flip-flop has multiple data inputs while a D latch has only one.
D flip-flop has multiple data inputs while a D latch has only one.
D flip-flop is faster in operation than a D latch.
D flip-flop changes its output on the clock's rising or falling edge, while a D latch is level triggered.

In sequential circuits, why is a clock signal necessary?
It increases the speed of the circuit operation.
It synchronizes the operations of multiple flip-flops.
It decreases power consumption by synchronizing the circuit operations.
It provides a reference voltage for the circuits.
