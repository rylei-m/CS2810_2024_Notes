Below are 3 parts of a  32-bit binary floating point number. Label the sections with their corresponding terms.

A: 1	
B: 010110	
C: 10101001001110110011011

1: Sign
2: Exponent
3: Mantissa

ANS:
A-1
B-2
C-3

If we have a modified IEEE754 system with 1 sign bit, 3 biased exponent bits (so you would subtract 3 rather than 127 to get the exponent), and 4 mantissa bits, where all other standards are the same, what is the following number in decimal?

0 111 0000

NaN
7
Zero
**Infinity**
