## Memory (RAM and Registers)

### Combinational Logic
- The Chips output is a Function of the Current Inputs, and the Current Input Only

ALU
- The Top Most Combination Circuit

### Sequential Logic
- Type of logic used for Circuits that can Remember

### Hello, Time
Software Needs:
- Hardware must be about to remember things
- The hardware must be able to do things one at a time (sequentially)

Hardware Needs:
- must handle the physical time delays associated with moving and computing data

Solution:
- Neutralize the Time Delays Using Discrete Time
- Time Steps and CLock
  - Cycle Length should be Slightly Larger than the Maximum Delay Time

### Register
##### How We Store Information
Storage of Memory and Bits
- Can Load a value
  - Assigning Values
- Can Store a Value

### RAM - Random Access Memory
##### A Bunch of Registers Stacked Together
- A Sequence of n addressable, w-bit registers

### Register File
##### A MIPS CPU interacts with Two MAin Forms of Memory
- Ram
  - Stores a Huge amount of Information
  - Slow to Access
- Registers
  - Store 32 Registers
  - Much Quicker to Access'
  - Used for Performing Calculations
- Ports
  - Read Register 1 & 2
  - Write Register
  - Write Data
  - RegWrite
  - Read Data 1 & 2
