# Intro

CPU - Something that takes input, runs programs on a processor, and return output. 

How does a computer work?


How are computers designed?


How can we leverage computers to run effectively?


Binary

Circuits

Wires

## Boolean Logic
### How Do Computers Represent Information?

Computers Store All Information As Boolean Values

Boolean Values - T/F, 1/0, On/Off

Is current flowing through wire or not (1/0)

### How to Store a Lot of information with Only 2 Values?
States


### How many different states can be represented by N binary variables?
2^N

### How Can We Manipulate Bool Values to Perform Complex Operations?
Boolean Operators
- A function that inputs and outputs boolean values
- NOT(!), AND(*), OR(+)

The Combination of These Operators Can Build Any Computer


## Boolean Algebra
Equations are constructable into Equations
- ex: A*(B+!C)
